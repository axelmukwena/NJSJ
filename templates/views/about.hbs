        <h2>An introduction</h2>
        </br>
        <p>
            Namibia continues to be one of the world’s most unequal nations caused, firstly, by colonialism and then by the neoliberal policies of the postcolonial State. The elite transition in post-colonial Namibia reflects what occurred throughout Africa. Local elites joined global elites to produce and reproduce intellectuals who seek to justify, rationalise, and normalise the neo-colonial order at the core of the current inequalities. Such neoliberal intellectuals dominate the intellectual space inside the state, academia and civil society. They form an elite compact to maintain their hegemony and the neoliberal order – the very order that produces inequality.
            </br>
            </br>
            To achieve social justice there is an urgent need to offer counter-hegemonic thinking. This responsibility lies with leftist thinkers to develop alternative ideas and practices that will lead to significant improvements in the lives of those negatively impacted by poverty and inequality. Leftist intellectuals and social justice activists must create alternative spaces to contest the neoliberal dogma.
            </br>
            </br>
            
The Namibian Journal of Social Justice (NJSJ) was established in 2021 and serves as a space to contest the mainstream ideas that underpin the neoliberal order. The NJSJ is as an intellectual platform for social justice academics who want to critically question that order and search for alternatives. Its ideological grounding is unapologetically left of the neoliberal intellectual spectrum. We hope that the journal will be used as a resource by academics, teachers, students, workers, youth activists, policy makers and others who are willing to engage in the struggle for social justice in Namibia.
            </br>
            </br>
            The NJSJ does not pretend nor assume an “open for all” character. It will promote a critical
leftist analysis and ideas which will advance the struggle for social justice in Namibia. In
doing so, the journal will uphold the principles of academic meticulousness and seek quality
academic research output and analyses on social justice and related issues. At the same time,
it will remain open to different forms of contributions (including opinion pieces, photo essays
etc.) and prioritise substance over form. In other words, the NJSJ will not only accept
academic articles of high quality but it will also publish activist accounts of struggles in
Namibia, Africa and globally.

 The Journal is published by the Economic and Social Justice Trust (ESJT). an organisation of
 volunteers dedicated to the achievement of economic and social justice (<a href="https://www.esjtnam.org/">www.esjtnam.org</a>).
